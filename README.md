# Crypto Token Using Solana Blockchain

## Overview

This project aims to create a blockchain and cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin using the Solana blockchain platform. The project leverages Solana's advanced features to address scalability and performance challenges faced by traditional blockchain networks. It includes the creation of a custom token, smart contracts, and tools for interacting with the blockchain.

## Features

- **Custom Token Creation:** Create a custom cryptocurrency token on the Solana blockchain.
- **Smart Contracts:** Develop smart contracts to define token behavior and functionality.
- **Token Minting:** Mint new tokens and distribute them to users.
- **Transaction Processing:** Enable users to transact with the created token on the Solana blockchain.
- **Wallet Integration:** Interact with the blockchain using Solana wallets and command-line tools.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation including whitepaper, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
