Usage Guidelines:

1. **Compilation**: Before deploying smart contracts, ensure they are compiled properly. Run the following command to compile smart contracts:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

2. **Deployment**: Once smart contracts are compiled, you can deploy them to the blockchain. Use the following command to deploy smart contracts:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. **Token Minting**: After deploying contracts, you can mint tokens to specific addresses. Use the following command to mint tokens:
   ```bash
   npm run mint --amount <amount> --recipient <recipient-address>
   ```
   Replace `<amount>` with the number of tokens to mint and `<recipient-address>` with the recipient's Solana address.

4. **Interaction with Blockchain**: Use the provided scripts in the `scripts/` directory to interact with the blockchain. These scripts may include functionalities like transferring tokens, querying balances, or invoking smart contract functions.

5. **Documentation**: For detailed information on project features, design, and functionality, refer to the project's documentation:
